## Inspiration
The inspiration I got for this application is from the theme of the [hackathon](https://mentalhealthhacksii.devpost.com). Whenever we feel low or our mental condition is not good, we want someone with whom we can share our stuff to feel relaxed.

## What it does
With the motivation of bringing people with similar moods together, this application has been developed. It creates room according to different moods the user may have, and in one particular room, only people with similar moods can interact.
